Completed my 10th challenge for Front End Mentor.
Really enjoyed making this one.
I did not find this one particullary difficult, but I did implement a new technique  "Grid-Template-Areas" to design my CSS Grid on the desktop version of the challenge.


As always,  feedback or suggestions are always welcome.

Thanks.
