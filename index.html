            I learned were current, if
            not more so,
            in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny&apos;s worth.</p>
          <p class="testimonial-quote testimonial-quote_daniel">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the
            bootcamp. I&apos;ve been
            looking to make a
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
            the course, I&apos;ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

          <p class="testimonial-quote testimonial-quote_female">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I&apos;ve never written a
            line of code. I needed
            some structure from
            professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
            did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
            project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
            could ever have. In fact, I&apos;ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
            100% recommend! ”</p>
